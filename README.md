<h1># Bot-Detection</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This project focuses on detecting bot accounts on Twitter using machine learning. Social media platforms like Twitter face challenges in distinguishing real users from automated bot accounts, which can spread misinformation, manipulate trends, and engage in spam activities. The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that classifies Twitter users as either bots or human accounts based on their activity and profile characteristics.

<h2>Project Goal</h2>
  
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that classifies Twitter users as either bots (1) or humans (0) using various account and tweet-related features.


<h2>üîç Approach & Methodology</h2>
  
The project follows these steps:  

</b> 1Ô∏è‚É£. Data Cleaning ‚Äì Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and formatting data.  

2Ô∏è‚É£. Feature Selection & Standardization ‚Äì Identifying key features and scaling numerical data.  

3Ô∏è‚É£. Splitting Data ‚Äì Dividing the dataset into training (80%)** and testing (20%) sets.  

4Ô∏è‚É£. Model Training ‚Äì Implementing machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression.  

5Ô∏è‚É£. Evaluation ‚Äì Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to assess model performance.  </b>
